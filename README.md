# Jumper
This game is about guessing letters in a word. 
Initially, the game board is drawn with underbars corresponding the number of letters in the word. 
Then the man with a parachute is drawn. 
You can guess any letters from a to z. 
If you guess right, the underbars are substituted with the letter you chose. 
If you guess wrong, the parachute will disappear one line at a time. 
You can guess wrong up to three times, but the parachute is gone after the fourth time and the game ends.
